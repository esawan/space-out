# space-out

ABOUT:\
Space Out is a React webapp made for our final project in App Development Practicum (CMSI 399). 

It is an app that helps people of all ages who are stressed to relax, by incorporating a variety of different relaxing mediums (like read-a-longs, music, games, creative tutorials, meditation videos, etc.), broken up into age groups.

Since we're living in such stressful and uncertain times, Space Out helps people of all ages calm down, as too much stress can be detrimental to your health.
